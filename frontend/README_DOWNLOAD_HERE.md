# Download Here Page (React)

This project includes a converted "Download here" screen from static HTML/CSS into modular React components.

- Entry page component: src/pages/DownloadHerePage.jsx
- Components: src/components/downloadHere/*
- Scoped CSS: src/styles/download-here-901-4.css
- Route: /download-here

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/download-here

Notes:
- Images are served from public/assets/... and were copied from assets/figmaimages.
- The existing home page still renders the original template and links to this page.
